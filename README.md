# Dashboard Project

This repository contains the code for a dashboard that can be used to visualize data from a variety of sources. The dashboard is built using a variety of open source tools, including React, Chart.js, and D3.js. It is designed to be easy to use and customize, and it can be used to track a wide range of metrics.

# This dashboard is divided into a few different sections:

    Overview - This section provides a high-level overview of the data, including charts showing the overall trend of the data, as well as the latest data points.
    Metrics - This section allows you to drill down into the data and view specific metrics. You can filter the data by time period, source, and other criteria.
    Charts - This section allows you to create custom charts that visualize the data in different ways. You can choose from a variety of chart types, and you can customize the appearance of the charts.
    Settings - This section allows you to configure the dashboard, such as changing the default time period or adding new metrics.

The dashboard is still under development, but it is already a powerful tool for visualizing data. I hope you find it useful!
